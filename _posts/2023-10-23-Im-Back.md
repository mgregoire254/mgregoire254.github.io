It's been a while since my last post.  Ive been busy with school but I'am finally almost at the end.  Lately I've been trying to update some of my projects. You can check them out here on my [Projects Page](https://mikegregoire.me/projects/).  I've also added a couple projects.

One of my recent projects has been trying to learn assembly for the 6502.  I have a repo on my github showing what I'm working on with this. Go check it out here [6502 Assembly learning](https://github.com/mgregoire254/6502-Assembly-Learning)

Ive also just put up a python program to make Flask projects easier.  It asks the user for the name of their project, then generates a boilerplate file structure for the app. Check it out here [Python Web App Boilerplate](https://github.com/mgregoire254/Python-Webapp-Boilerplate-Script)
