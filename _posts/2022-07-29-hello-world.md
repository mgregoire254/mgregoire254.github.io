# Hello, World!

For most of us "Hello, World!" is the first lines of code that we type. This being the case, I thought that it would make a perfect first blog post.  

```python
print("Hello, World!  My name is Mike, and this is my first post!!!!")
```

I'm currently a Computer Science student at UoPeople and this is my new blog/portfolio site.  I will be making posts about different topics and look forward to writing some tutorials as time goes on.  I hope to become a software developer when I graduate and will be documenting my journey here.
