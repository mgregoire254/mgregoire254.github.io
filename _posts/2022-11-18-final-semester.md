# Final Semester

It's hard to believe it but I have officially started my last semester at University of the People.  Its been a long journey and while I'm glad to be graduating I will also miss school.

## Whats Next
Now that I'm nearing the end of my school journey, I will be focusing more on this site as well as polishing my resume and finishing my portfolio projects.  I'm excited for whats ahead and will post updates here soon.
