Ive been busy with school but I’am finally almost at the end. Lately I’ve been trying to update some of my projects. You can check them out here on my Projects Page. I’ve also added a couple projects.One of my recent projects has been trying to learn assembly for the 6502. I have a repo on my github showing what I’m working on with this. Go check it out here 6502 Assembly learningIve also just put up a python program to make Flask projects easier. It asks the user for the name of their project, then generates a boilerplate file structure for the app. Check it out here Python Web App Boilerplate" }, { "title": "Data Structures and Algorithms", "url": "/posts/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/", "categories": "school, computer science, career", "tags": "school, career", "date": "2022-11-30 05:00:00 -0600", "snippet": "Today I decided to do some practice with data structures and algorithms in Java. I decided to write a post going over some of the basics.StacksStacks are a Last in First Out data structure. This is like a stack of items in real life. The last or “top” item is the first one to come off when you start taking items off the stack.To create a stack in java we can use the syntax:Stack&lt;String&gt; stack = new Stack&lt;String&gt;();This would create a new instance of the Stack object called “stack”.Methods for working with stacks include push(add), pop(remove) and peek(look at the top but dont remove). Here are some examples:stack.push(\"Minecraft\");stack.pop();stack.peek();Check out some code i wrote up working with stacks in Java on my github here" }, { "title": "Resume", "url": "/posts/resume/", "categories": "school, computer science, career", "tags": "school, career", "date": "2022-11-28 05:00:00 -0600", "snippet": "Ive been working to update my resume in preparation for my job search and its finally done!

I had always wondered how negative numbers are handled at the low level in computers since representing them in binary is an issue. Overall I understood the concepts but for some reason doing conversions into two’s complement just wasnt clicking. I think it was just the way it was being explained. I decided to make this quick post just in case anyone else is having trouble.The steps Invert the bits Add 1Yes its really that easy. I felt really stupid after I figured it out.ExamplesLets take a number, say 011101 and apply these steps to it. The first step is to invert the bits. So 011101 becomes 100010. Next we add 1. So 100010 becomes 100011. And thats it! Just make any 0 a 1 and any 1 a zero then add one." }, { "title": "Hello World", "url": "/posts/hello-world/", "categories": "programming, personal", "tags": "code", "date": "2022-07-29 06:00:00 -0500", "snippet": "Hello, World!For most of us “Hello, World!” is the first lines of code that we type. This being the case, I thought that it would make a perfect first blog post.print(\"Hello, World! My name is Mike, and this is my first post!!!!\")I’m currently a Computer Science student at UoPeople and this is my new blog/portfolio site. I will be making posts about different topics and look forward to writing some tutorials as time goes on. I hope to become a software developer when I graduate and will be documenting my journey here." } ]
